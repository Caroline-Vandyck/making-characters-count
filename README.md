# Making Characters Count

This repository contains all code and data used in the book chapter: Making Characters Count: The computational verification of scribal profiles in the Middle Dutch manuscripts from the Herne monastery (14th century)

All code is executable using the paths as defined. In the folder 'html', the scatterplot with hover functionalities can be found, as this output cannot be saved in the code itself. Images of the plots have been added in the notebook, but with no functionalities. The scatterplots can differ slightly each time they are executed. Nonetheless, the result are reproducable.

The data is available on Zenodo in the following repository: Haverals, W., & Kestemont, M. (2023). The Middle Dutch Manuscripts Surviving from the Carthusian Monastery of Herne (14th century) (Camready; rc0-0, with pagexml, code, spreadsheets) [Data set]. Computational Humanities Research Conference (CHR), Paris. Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10005366
